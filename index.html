	<h2> WHY SMART CITY </h2>
	
	<p style="font-size: 27px; "> Smart cities are designed for optimum usage of space and resources along with an efficient and optimum distribution of benefits. It also aims at increasing connectivity at various levels among citizens, as well as between the administration and population. Public properties such as schools, roads, and hospitals are improved.

			The way we get around has become the great protagonist, a challenge that in dense urban areas is a priority. New York City has found its solution in <strong>electric buses</strong>. <br> The city government has proposed improving its traffic flow by installing sensors in these buses and at traffic lights, so that when a bus approaches a traffic light, either the green light is extended or the red changes to green in anticipation.<br> This way of prioritizing the passage of buses at intersections has already led to travel times being reduced by 20%.

			 Asian tigers, including Singapore, Japan and South Korea, have begun to bring innovation to their healthcare systems. Along the corridors of one of Singapore’s major centres, Changi General Hospital, doctors, patients and robots are already walking. HOSPI, a human-sized autonomous robot, has been operating for two years and its mission is to transport drugs, files and blood samples throughout this hospital’s four buildings. It is not the only robot in the centre, in which autonomous loading devices and robot surgeons also operate. The latter are also common in Japan.

		<h4> PROGRAMMING EDUCATION </h4>
		<img src="https://digitaluniversities.guideassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016_2_3_04.jpg"/>
		<p style="font-size: 27px; ">
			 The last great project that a smart city needs is precisely that which ensures all the others: education. The devices and ideas that will make life easier for the city dweller in the future will be developed by those who are today still at school. Singapore, winner of the PISA report, has its goal clear: to teach computer programing. This measure already reaches more than 20,000 children between the ages of three and 12. It starts from nursery schools, where children begin to play with robots, learning how to program them in a basic way. Once at school, programming becomes a core subject: video games, drones, 3D printers, circuits and robots.
